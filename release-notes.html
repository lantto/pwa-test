        <ul>
            <li>Power
                <ul>
                    <li>Your ability and spell levels are now capped by your power level</li>
                    <li>Warriors and rangers
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mana bar has been replaced with a power bar</li>
                            <li>Dealing damage to mobs will fill your power bar and thus your ability levels</li>
                            <li>Power will reset to 0 if you don't deal any damage for 10 seconds</li>
                            <li>Once the power hits the soft cap (equal to level 40) it will start glowing and reset after 20 seconds
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Power will still increase past the soft cap during the 20 seconds timeout but it won't show in the bar</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mages
                        <ul>
                            <li>Power will automatically fill when standing still</li>
                            <li>Power will reset on movement or when casting a spell</li>
                            <li>No soft cap so max power will always cast the spell at spell book level (still respecting mana stone level)</li>
                            <li>This means that your spell book level is evenly distributed along the power curve</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Critical hit
                        <ul>
                            <li>You now have a 5% chance of dealing a critical hit adding 50% extra damage</li>
                            <li>Power adds to the critical hit chance (up to +20%)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lumerium items
                <ul>
                    <li>The Gnome Shop now sells a few new items: Gnome charger, gnome battery and lumerium generator</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By using a lumerium generator powered by a gnome battery you can process various items</li>
                        <li>To charge a gnome you need 5 green lumen, 5 red lumen and 5 blue lumen</li>
                        <li>Chest -> Gnome charger -> Gnome battery</li>
                        <li>Each charged gnome has 10 power. Once power is depleted in the battery the gnome will disappear</li>
                        <li>Place a lumerium generator next to a charged gnome battery and insert a valid item to activate it</li>
                        <li>Diamond: using a diamond in a generator will require 50 power and spawn a lumerium ore vein somewhere in the overworld</li>
                        <li>Lumerium gear: using lumerium ingots you can now craft lumerium sword, lumerium bow, lumerium mana stone and lumerium necklace in the crafting table</li>
                        <li>Lumerium gear can be leveled up in a lumerium generator and will require more and more gnome power the higher level it is</li>
                        <li><strong>Important</strong>: when processing an item the current power will start winding down unless it's actively powered by a charged gnome battery. Since it takes longer for a gnome to be charged than a gnome battery to be consumed this means you will need to queue up the amount of charged gnomes needed before you start processing or the power and gnomes will go to waste</li>
                        <li>Lumerium necklace counts as jewelry so it takes up the same equipment slot as rings</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Xazar's Domain
                <ul>
                    <li>When you have acquired a lumerium item you may notice it's useless in the overworld. Lumerium gear can only be used in certain instances, the first being the domains of Xazar</li>
                    <li>Xazar's Domain is an instanced dungeon for up to 4 players and costs 100 lumen shards to open</li>
                    <li>You can restrict the dungeon to solo, everyone or your guild only</li>
                    <li>The dungeon is open until no-one has been active in it for 20 minutes</li>
                    <li>Runes
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mobs and chests drop runes as loot, which can be socketed into lumerium gear at the runemaster</li>
                            <li>Runes have level requirements for the respective lumerium items</li>
                            <li>Killing mobs will give you lumen XP which grants you lumen levels (lumen level and progress can be shown in the character sheet) and aside from leveling up your lumen gear level to match the rune you also need to be at least that lumen level to use it</li>
                            <li>The requirement is decided by the rune, not the lumerium gear level (so you can safely level it up and still use it as long as it's socketed with a rune that is below or same as your level)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mobs also drop lumen daler which can be used in the lumen shop</li>
                    <li>Portal stones
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can buy portal stones from the lumen shop, which are used to open a portal back to the instance town</li>
                            <li>The portals are open until the dungeon is closed down or you open a new portal</li>
                            <li>Portal stone cost increases the further you get</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can sell runes in the shop for lumen daler</li>
                    <li>Finding a checkpoint portal will permanently register it for all active players in the dungeon, and be available in all subsequent instances</li>
                    <li>You can pray at the shrine to heal and restore your stamina for free</li>
                    <li>No PvP is allowed here</li>
                    <li>When dying you will be sent to the shrine and healed but will lose 10% of the currently accumulated lumen XP toward next level</li>
                    <li>Max level is currently 20</li>
                    <li>Xazar's Domain is procedurally generated each time it's opened so you may get a broken world. Please report those in Discord</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Arrows revamp
                <ul>
                    <li>Crafting arrows will now give you a batch of arrows but they always have a 50% probability to break on impact</li>
                    <li>There are new items to help you reduce arrow spill</li>
                    <li>Trashing the old deprecated arrows will reimburse you the full crafting cost</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New stash UI
                <ul>

                    <li>The inventory is now always shown beneath and you can filter by item name through the new search bar</li>
                    <li>Item attributes (rings, swords, runes etc) will now be displayed directly in the UI when selected</li>
                    <li>Press an item twice on mobile to see the item description if available (hover as usual on desktop)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sheep above tier 1 now require hay to produce wool. Hay can be found in Xazar's Domain</li>
            <li>The eating popup is now smaller and should not stick around when you're not eating or behave in strange ways</li>
            <li>Gnomes that are carrying items no longer block gnomes that are not carrying items</li>
            <li>Gnomes no longer pathfind through doors
                <ul>
                    <li>This is very useful when queuing a lot of gnomes for charging</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Local chat in instanced dungeons and box will now propagate to all players in that instance regardless of distance</li>

                    <li>Oak bows
                        <ul>
                            <li>All bows now have durability but oak bows have a much larger durability base, are affected by blacksmithing and can be repaired</li>
                            <li>Oak bows can also be infused with a beetle (found in trees)</li>
                        </ul>

            <li>Fusing table
                <ul>
                    <li>All ground crafting (except treasure maps) have been moved to fusing tables:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Combine gems</li>
                            <li>Infuse swords with gems</li>

            </li>
            <li>Mining and woodcutting changes
                <ul>
                    <li>Mining and woodcutting speed now scales much much slower</li>
                    <li>Copper, silver, gold and diamond pickaxes/axes now have the same speed but each tier above copper gives you an additional stone or log (does not affect noble metals)</li>
                    <li>You can only get gems and beetles from silver and above. The chance scales with material (silver lowest, diamond highest)</li>
                    <li>Mining and woodcutting speed is now synced to movement speed 
                        <ul>
                            <li>This means speed increase from leveling is phased, increasing each time you hit a new divisor</li>
                            <li>A side effect of this is that speed boots will now increase the mining and woodcutting speed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            <li>Drop rate of noble metals outside mines have been greatly nerfed</li>

            <li>You can now lock your equipped item from the abilities/spells tab
                <ul>
                    <li>This should make it easier to loot, especially on mobile, preventing you from accidentally unequipping your weapon</li>
                    <li>There may also be a new item making looting even easier</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The King can now indirectly defend their castle by pouring boiling oil on entrances to the throne room</li>
                    <li>Oil deals damage every 2 seconds for 1 minute: 10% damage when boiling and 50% damage when burning (when poured it boils for a while before erupting into flames)</li>
                    <li>To pour oil you need to give olive oil and coal to the Kingsguards Commander. Olive oil is made from olives</li>

                    <li>The Swapper is a new NPC in Southtown and Snowtown, easy to spot by their fancy suit and hat, that functions as an Automatic Market Maker (AMM)</li>
                    <li>Players can buy and sell certain raw materials for a price that is automatically adjusted according to supply and demand</li>
                    <li>In order for the AMM to function it uses a Liquidity Pool (LP) where players can lock up items and get an interest rate (a proportional cut of the 0.3% fee on every trade)</li>
                    <li>You can withdraw your share of the LP at any time but the current exchange rate will be applied so you won't necessarily get the exact same amount of items back</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This kind of goes against the sandbox spirit but it's only temporary until I have a solution where you can't accidentally leave your pens unlocked, so you should still lock your stables</li>
                    <li>I'm also thinking that there might be a bug where doors get unlocked by themselves. I've heard a lot of reports like that but haven't been able to reproduce it</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Old tutorial NPCs have been replaced with new quest NPCs</li>
                    <li>Currently give kill, gather and delivery quests but more will be added</li>
                    <li>A lot of kill missions have been removed and replaced with new quest NPCs</li>
                    <li>You can access active quests through the star icon, together with missions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A lot of UX and UI fixes
                <ul>
                    <li>Too many to write down but you will notice</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A lot of mobile changes and fixes
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g. inventory etc are no longer displayed all the time but needs to be brought up by tapping the inventory icon (you can re-enable showing it all the time in the Options)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ground crafting is gone
                <ul>
                    <li>You can now craft all standard items through the new crafting menu</li>
                    <li>You still need crafting tables to unlock all crafting recipes</li>
                    <li>Fire swords and treasure maps still need to be crafted on ground due to some legacy stuff</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some missions have been reworked to fit the new progression</li>
            <li>You can no longer trigger instant things like food, arrows etc from the inventory. They need to be in the hotbar</li>
            <li>Another big patch is in the works but has been postponed since I wanted the new tutorial out as soon as possible</li>
        </ul>

                                <li>Same cost for ingots as before (6 ores), instant and requires no fuel</li>
                                <li>You can also use furnaces to smelt down items, which will give you back the ingot cost minus 1 (red gems will lose one level)</li>

            </li>
            <li>Durability has been greatly increased on all weapons and armor

                    <li>It is recommended to smelt down items with the old durability and recraft them</li>

                    <li>You can now teleport mounts between all public and private stables (costs 5 coins)</li>
                    <li>When stabling mounts their cart and rein will be stashed as well</li>
                    <li>You can use the Rescue service at public stables to teleport pets in the wild to that stable
                        <ul>
                            <li>There's a rescue fee of 30 coins when collecting your pet</li>

            <li>New egg mini game</li>
            <li>Taming chickens
                <ul>
                    <li>It is now possible to tame chickens</li>
                    <li>Blue chickens spawning magical eggs have been added</li>
                    <li>All chickens have an egg dominance value deciding whether it will spawn their unique egg (regular eggs and magic eggs) or one of the colored bird eggs</li>
                    <li>Eggs laid by chickens will now decay outside plots</li>
                    <li>Other pets will eat regular eggs and magic eggs so don't keep them in the same stable</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sheep
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use shears (new item) to shear wool from a sheep in a stable you own</li>
                    <li>Wool is used to craft Wizard Hats which will now give you a passive mana regeneration boost depending on wool quality...</li>
                    <li>Wool quality can be increased by breeding sheeps of different blood lines (the darker the wool the better the quality)</li>
                    <li>Lineage
                        <ul>
                            <li>By drinking a Genealogy potion (new item, brewed with Magic eggs) you will see a visual representation of the sheep's genes and blood lines</li>
                            <li>After taming a sheep you will also see their blood line in the pop-up</li>
                            <li>You can breed two sheeps of same tier by putting them in the same stable, which will eventually spawn a higher tier lamb with their combined blood lines</li>
                            <li>In order for a lamb to spawn the parents' blood lines cannot overlap (i.e. they need to have uniquely different blood lines) and there needs to be space in the enclosure as per the regular stable rules
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Example: Sheep with blood lines AB cannot mate with BC but can mate with CD, spawning a lamb with blood lines ABCD</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Mana potions are now quaffed instantly and restores 40% of your mana (quaff cooldown of 10 seconds is shared with other potions)
                <ul>
                    <li>Heads up: Mana potions will likely require Magic eggs when brewed in the future</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When hiring a Kingsguards half of the cost goes into a buffer that's released into the treasury chest when a new King is coronated</li>
            <li>You can no longer take the throne with Kingsguards alive. You will still get flagged and attacked if trying to take it but the timer won't trigger at all so it's futile</li>
            <li>Fixed critical bug not saving and respawning Kingsguards correctly (thanks taylorryver for helping me debug this!)</li>
            <li>When a pet has been fully trained outside of stables it will show in the pop-up</li>
            <li>Pets no longer block you unless you have a taming staff equipped</li>
            <li>Roll call and transport birds can now be used independently of staffs</li>
            <li>Archery and sorcery have been added to the skill scrolls</li>
            <li>Bug fix: mana stones will not break if no spell is cast</li>
            <li>Cleaned up sorting order in the crafting table</li>
            <li>New safeguard for state consistency. It will now try to shut down the server as soon as it detects a possible anomaly, to prevent further discrepancies and server states getting out of sync (work in progress)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Overhaul of classes
                <ul>
                    <li>Abilities and spells now live in a sub menu where you can switch between inventory, class specific things and paint
                        <ul>
                            <li>The only way to trigger abilities and spells are through the hotbar. Ability/spell items are different from the ability/spell itself (differentiated by a yellow glow) so you will likely need to update your hotbar and assign the ability/spell instead</li>
                            <li>Clicking on an ability/spell in the list will show stats about it</li>
                            <li>Recipes list and drop button have been moved to the same sub menu when inventory is open</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Abilities and spells are now upgradeable at the job centre, costing a certain amount of scrolls/books and coins for each level
                        <ul>
                            <li>Abilities/spells have been added as loot to most monsters. Different monsters drop different stuff and <em>they will <strong>only</strong> drop things related to your <strong>current class</strong></em> (so killing a monster as warrior only gives warrior abilities as loot)</li>
                            <li>You can only have two abilities per class active at the same time (but unlimited spells). Use the checkbox at the job centre to toggle them</li>
                            <li>You can no longer craft abilities/spells</li>

                            <li>2 new abilities</li>
                            <li>It no longer costs mana to activate an ability</li>

                            <li>Rogue has been renamed to ranger (rogue will make a comeback in another form)</li>
                            <li>Can no longer use bombs or knives</li>
                            <li>Copper, silver, gold and diamond arrows have been added</li>
                            <li>Fire bomb arrows have been added</li>
                            <li>Bow is now equippable and has an inherent melee damage (kick?)</li>
                            <li>You now shoot arrows using the hotbar by assiging the arrow to it and having the bow equipped</li>
                            <li>Archery skill has been added which scales the same as swordsmanship (faster shooting and increased damage)</li>
                            <li>4 new abilities</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mage
                        <ul>
                            <li>In order to cast a spell you need to equip a mana stone (new item) and then cast the spell through the hotbar (remember that you need to assign the spell from the spell menu and not the item itself)</li>
                            <li>Mana stones have an inherent melee damage</li>
                            <li>There are iron, copper, silver, gold and diamond mana stones. Each one has a max level for spells (e.g. if your spell level is 7 it will be capped by an iron mana stone which has a max level of 5)</li>
                            <li>Upgrading spells increase their mana cost at the same interval as the max level of mana stones, so you can effectively use a mana stone to downgrade a spell for it to cost less (but of course also making it less powerful)</li>
                            <li>Casting a spell will decrease the durability of the mana stone</li>
                            <li>Sorcery skill has been added which scales the same as swordsmanship (faster casting and increased damage)</li>
                            <li>Shock wave has been removed</li>
                            <li>Mages can no longer use staffs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tamers have no abilities or spells (all current spells have been removed) but instead have...</li>
                            <li>Birds
                                <ul>
                                    <li>On the map random flocks of chickens lay eggs you can pick up</li>
                                    <li>Normal eggs are just for food (fried egg) but special eggs can be put in incubators (new item) to hatch a bird</li>
                                    <li>Birds can then be put in bird's nests (new item) to lay more eggs</li>
                                    <li>By having a staff equipped you can launch birds through the hotbar</li>
                                    <li>Attack bird: This is for D3XU5. The bow is back!... kind of</li>
                                    <li>Target bird: Low damage but makes your pets attack the target (attack bird has higher damage but doesn't aggro your pets on it). Replaces the "All, attack!" command</li>
                                    <li>Signal bird: Same as and replaces the "All, seek and destroy!" command
                                    <li>Transport bird: Same as and replaces the Summon Pets spell</li>
                                    <li>Roll call bird: Same as and replaces the List pets command</li>
                                    <li>Heal bird: Heals pets for 100hp in a 3x3 pattern on impact</li>
                                    <li>New boss drop added for making more efficient bird farms (it will also have another use in the future)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>You can no longer hit your own pets</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>All classes now insta eat food and consume potions when having a weapon equipped</li>
                    <li>This is all work in progress and most likely very unbalanced so let me know if you have any feedback!</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Most UI elements are now customizable. Feed and inventory are also resizable (when inventory is resized it will become scrollable)</li>
                <li>When detaching the log/chat feed upon customization an arrow to expand it will become available (so you can have a really small feed but expand it when you want to read)</li>
                <li>You can now align the whole viewport to the left, center or right</li>
                <li>Added experimental fullscreen mode. It has a lot of quirks, e.g. when you resize the window (including going from/to actual fullscreen in the browser) it will reset all UI. It's also a bit buggy. Sometimes a resize won't actually reposition the elements correctly but make it a jumbled mess (if it happens a reload or "Reset UI" should fix it). Work in progress...</li>
                <li>Graphics have been renamed to Options</li>
                <li>You can now disable shadows in the settings. The shadows require a lot of complex drawing operations so disabling them should give a performance boost when rendering new chunks.. but also make everything look flat</li>
                <li>You can now disable the log overlay (when log messages overlay the chat window). Let me know if there are anything else that should be configurable</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue making the bars too small when customizing with the new scale mode</li>
                <li>Changing graphics settings no longer resets UI customization</li>
                <li>FPS meter now also shows your ping</li>
                <li>Hotbar is now visible on mobile</li>
                <li>On mobile, clicking the inventory icon when already selected will bring up an expanded view of the inventory that is scrollable (there's space to the right for scrolling so you don't accidentally drag'n'drop items when scrolling)</li>
                <li>Fixed instruction text for paint showing on mobile</li>
                <li>Pressing escape when map is open will no longer open the menu behind it</li>
                <li>Fixed bug not spawning bone piles on big enemies correctly</li>
                <li>Tab will now focus the chat instead of opening the map</li>

                <li>Fixed a bug causing some players to be frozen a while after loading the game</li>

        <ul>
            <li>New rendering engine
                <ul>
                    <li>The 3rd iteration of trying to improve performance</li>
                    <li>Still not 100% done but releasing it early to test it out</li>
                    <li>The most visible change is that it renders clouds instead of blurring levels beneath player</li>
                    <li>Added an algorithm for preventing frantic Z level layer switching when building rows of walls on higher levels</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Graphics options
                <ul>
                    <li>You can now choose between different scale modes and also switch back to the old rendering engine if you encounter any issues</li>
                    <li>Scale Mode A is using a CSS transform while Scale Mode B is using regular CSS properties to scale it. The old Scale Mode is scaling the actual spritesheet (slow on many devices)</li>
                    <li>Added an FPS meter and also the ability to disable grayscale when you are dead (causes bad performance on some devices)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Target finding optimizations
                <ul>
                    <li>Completely remade how NPCs find targets, which is one of the most taxing operations on the servers</li>
                    <li>This will lead to a slightly different behavior but hopefully doesn't introduce any major issues. However, if you notice something strange with the AI please let me know on Discord!</li>
                    <li>Still much more that can be done to optimize this so work in progress</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Gnome Workshops and Lumen Stones now show units produced and units required per minute for input/output</li>
            <li>Lumen Shard changes:
                <ul>
                    <li>The cost of queueing Kingsguards now increases by 1 for every 100 existing queue slots (0-99: 1, 100-199: 2 etc)</li>
                    <li>World Boss prices have been increased by 1</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Glorb Dungeon now only gives a consolation prize of 5 Lumen Coins if you die in the first few rooms, so no more kamikaze farming of Red Lumen Stones</li>
            <li>Fixed some incorrect pixels in shadows. Should look a bit better when scaled</li>
            <li>Fixed an error preventing the game from loading in Firefox Mobile (there may be more, please report on Discord)</li>
            <li>The Missions and Chat indicators now only blinks three times</li>
            <li>Moving through a portal or dungeon stairs now halts the player</li>
            <li>Eastern King's crown now has a different sprite to differentiate the Kings</li>
            <li>"You're sending messages too fast!" trigger decreased to 0.5 seconds</li>
            <li>Pressing M will now open the map</li>
            <li>Disabled Spore Colonies on islands. The islands only run a subset of features right now and having NPCs (like Magic Mushrooms) on an island may corrupt it completely</li>
            <li>Fixed some more "null" action texts</li>
            <li>Added som easter eggs</li>

                    <li>Gnomes and gnome items can be purchased from the gnome village/island in the archipelago west of Spider Cave</li>
                    <li>On your island, set up a production chain of gnomes and gnome workshops to mine lumen stones and refine the lumen into lumen coins and lumen shards</li>
                    <li>To assign a gnome, select it and then use it on the checkpoints in the order the gnome should work. Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mine lumen stones</strong>

                                    <li>Place a lumen stone</li>
                                    <li>Place a chest</li>
                                    <li>Select gnome and use it on the lumen stone and then on the chest</li>
                                    <li>The gnome will go to the lumen stone, start mining (mining takes 12 seconds) and put the lumen into the chest</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Place a gnome workshop, select green lumen square</li>
                                    <li>Place a chest</li>
                                    <li>Select gnome and use it on the chest with the green lumen mined from the stone, then on the gnome workshop and finally on the chest where it should place the manufactured square</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>For recipes requiring multiple items the pick-up chest will need to contain everything required (the gnome will wait at the chest until it is fulfilled)</li>
                    <li>Gnomes can also be assigned to just transport items between two chests</li>
                    <li>Gnomes have some rules on when they will block each other:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gnomes carrying items will be blocked by other gnomes carrying items</li>
                            <li>Other gnomes will only be blocked by gnomes who are waiting (clock) or are broken (exclamation mark)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Gnome tablets can be used to manage your gnomes (and pause production). When using the tablet while standing on a route checkpoint the gnomes in that route will be highlighted</li>
                    <li>Gnomes will become broken if their assigned route has its checkpoints changed (e.g. chest or workshop removed) or if their route has been blocked (e.g. by walls or facing off with another gnome). You can resume and let them try again (after fixing the issue) with the gnome tablet</li>
                    <li>Lumen stones contain 200 lumen by default and can be refilled by using another lumen stone on it</li>
                    <li>Gnome items have been added as boss drops to dillute the loot table</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dungeon Master
                <ul>
                    <li>In the Kingstowns there are now new buildings housing the Dungeon Master</li>
                    <li>The Dungeon Master lets you enter procedurally generated dungeons and challenges by paying a fee in lumen coins</li>
                    <li>There's currently just one dungeon available (mostly as a proof of concept) which rewards you with red lumen stones required to craft lumen shards in your gnome factory</li>
                    <li>Dying in the dungeon will not actually kill you but instead teleport you to the exit room where you get a reward based on how far you made it. This means that dying in a challenge dungeon is risk-free</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>World Boss Summoner
                <ul>

                    <li>Summoning a world boss costs lumen shards and can only be done by the King</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lumen shards can also be used to queue up Kingsguards</li>
            <li>Stuff outside plots and islands will now decay over time. The higher level the player is the longer the decay time is</li>
            <li>Food will now be eaten directly on inventory selection when having a sword equipped, without having to change active item and manually eat it (similar to how abilities like Bash and Slam work, only warriors for now)</li>
            <li>Items will now display anything above 1000 with a k notation. You can hover the item to see the exact quantity</li>
            <li>When typing in local chat a "..." bubble will now show above the player</li>
            <li>Criminals can now be resurrected in towns (murderers still cannot)</li>
            <li>You can no longer build blocks or stairs on the max level</li>
            <li>When changing Z level it no longer does an unnecessary full redraw which should decrease the lag</li>
            <li>Entities walking into projectiles and spells should now correctly register as a hit</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug causing doors to get visually stuck after certain sequences</li>
            <li>When having Zoom enabled it now tints the sprite correctly (e.g. red when hit and blue when frozen) without blur and overflow</li>
            <li>Earthquake, snow trails etc now renders below entities</li>
            <li>Fixed one case of black screen and frozen browser after teleport (there may be more, please report!)</li>
            <li>A lot of different "Server down" errors instead of an infinitely loading spinner</li>
            <li>Chat bubbles now renders correctly when Zoom is used</li>
            <li>Fixed some items (such as map fragments) showing "null" instead of "drop" on the action button</li>
            <li>Crops next to plots can now be harvested (but nothing new can be sowed next to a plot)</li>
            <li>Various implementations of stuff behind-the-scenes to enable features and changes in future updates</li>
            <li>Fixed a lot of issues causing various server errors and warnings</li>
            <li>Most time was obviously spent creating the new server infrastructure which was a massive project. Next patch will focus on all the feature requests/suggestions and bug reports that have piled up</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I've made huge changes to the whole architecture to better support more concurrent players and pets</li>
                    <li>If you're interested in the techniques used it's mostly been about implementing quadtrees, spatial partioning, position caches, memoization and updating socket protocols</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately the socket upgrade made the old transfer protocol non-compatible which means the version ping-pong that usually detects whether a client needs to be updated stopped working as well. Make sure you do a hard reload in case it doesn't work</li>
                    <li>Some of the more experimental optimizations may actually backfire and give worse performance but I need to measure it first</li>
                    <li>This patch focuses entirely on server optimizations, another patch will focus on getting better client and rendering performance</li>

            <li>Added a warning 10 seconds before the hourly server save to prepare you for the lag</li>
            <li>Chatting will now refresh your AFK timer</li>
            <li>Your client will no longer automatically try to reconnect after a disconnection
                <ul>
                    <li>You will instead get a popup telling you that you have disconnected together with a Reload button</li>
                    <li>This is a regression but until I've figured out a way to gracefully reconnect a client and avoid all the strangeness that came with it I think this is better</li>
                    <li>If you experience a lot of disconnections please report it on <a href="https://discord.gg/DX74sGX">Discord</a> together with the reason shown in the popup</li>
